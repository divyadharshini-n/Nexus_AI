## Required Image

Please save the Mitsubishi equipment image (the one with PLCs, servos, and robots) as:

**File name:** `mitsubishi-equipment.jpg`
**Location:** `d:\docker\frontend\public\assets\images\mitsubishi-equipment.jpg`

This image will be displayed as a background with transparency on:
- Login page (85% opacity dark, 75% opacity light)
- Dashboard page (88% opacity dark, 80% opacity light)
- Workspace page (90% opacity dark, 82% opacity light)

The image will be visible through the semi-transparent overlay, giving a professional industrial look to the application.
